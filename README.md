## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Stacks blockchain node
- Clarity development environment
- Node.js for testing

### Installation

1. Clone the repository
   \`\`\`bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd atmospheric-engineering
   \`\`\`

2. Install dependencies
   \`\`\`bash
   npm install
   \`\`\`

3. Run tests
   \`\`\`bash
   npm test
   \`\`\`

### Deployment

Deploy contracts to Stacks testnet:
\`\`\`bash
clarinet deploy --testnet
\`\`\`

## Usage Examples

### Submitting a Project
\`\`\`clarity
(contract-call? .project-verification submit-project
"Carbon Capture Initiative"
"Large-scale atmospheric CO2 removal project"
"Pacific Ocean")
\`\`\`

### Creating Impact Model
\`\`\`clarity
(contract-call? .impact-modeling create-impact-model
u1          ;; project-id
-1000000    ;; CO2 reduction (tons)
-2          ;; temperature change (0.1°C)
5           ;; precipitation change (%)
u85)        ;; confidence level (85%)
\`\`\`

### Reporting Safety Alert
\`\`\`clarity
(contract-call? .safety-monitoring report-safety-alert
u1                    ;; project-id
u7                    ;; severity (1-10)
"equipment-failure"   ;; alert type
"Monitoring equipment malfunction detected"
"Station Alpha")      ;; location
\`\`\`

## Governance Model

1. **Project Lifecycle**:
    - Submission → Verification → Approval → Implementation → Monitoring

2. **International Coordination**:
    - Country registration
    - Proposal submission
    - Democratic voting
    - Consensus building

3. **Safety Protocols**:
    - Continuous monitoring
    - Alert escalation
    - Emergency response
    - Risk mitigation

## Testing

The project includes comprehensive tests using Vitest:

\`\`\`bash
npm run test
\`\`\`

Test coverage includes:
